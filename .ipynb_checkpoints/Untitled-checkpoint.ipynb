    "# 3 Docker Images\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Understanding Docker Image \n",
    "\n",
    "_An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application - the code, a runtime, libraries, emvironment variables and configuration files._ \n",
    "\n",
    "A container is a runtime instance of an image. i.e. an image is a container that is not running.\n",
    "![](figs/img_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1. Layered file systems\n",
    "![](figs/img_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Images are made up of __read-only__ layers.\n",
    "* Multiple containers are typically based on same image.\n",
    "* When an imgage is instantiated into a contaier, __a top writable layer is created__, which is deleted when the container is removed. \n",
    "* Docker uses __storage Drivers__ to amange the contents of the image layers and the writable container latyers. \n",
    "* Each storage driver handles them implementation differently.\n",
    "* All drivers use stackable image layers and __copy-on-write__ (COW) strategy. \n",
    "* This is why Docker containers are called __state-less__\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2. Dockerfile\n",
    "![](figs/img_3.png)\n",
    "* A dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. A dockerfile is executed by the `docker build` command.\n",
    "* The `docker build` command looks for the `Dockerfile` by default if not specify explicitly. \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Verification__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the image ID of the newly created image using `docker images` command \n",
    "2. Check the information prvided onto the Dockerfile in the image using `docker inspect {image_ID}` comamnd\n",
    "3. Check the order the commands/layers are applied using `docker image history {image_ID}`\n",
    "4. If Dockerfile is located elsewhere `docker build -f {PATH} {build_context}` command.  Specific attention to be taken when building a docker image from a remote Dockerfile. By default the `build_context = .` which includes all files at that directory to be part of the docker file-system. The `build context` specifies which files to be included. \n",

    "| CMD | Provides arguments for the entrypoint (only one is allowed) |\n",
    "| ENV | Denies the environmental variable in the container |\n",
    "| FROM | Defines the base image; the FROM instruction must be the first instruction in the Dockerfile |\n",
    "| MAINTAINER | email of the author (Depcricated) |\n",
    "| ONBUILD | Only used as a trigger when this image is used to build other images; will define command to run \"on-build\" |\n",

    "### 3.1.4. Dockerfile best practices\n",
    "1. build context must be taken into consideration.\n",
    "2. `.dockerignore` file specifies certain file patter to be ignores to be included while building.\n",
    "3. Each container should be of sinigle __Concern__ i.e. runnning single application.\n",
    "4. Break multiple instrucion into multi-line using `\\` for better organization.\n",
    "5. Link togather `apt -y update && apt install`\n",
